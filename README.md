# flutterPractice
We are gonna use this repository to practice both Flutter and Version Management.

For the first parts, we will learn Stateless Widgets from here The Net Ninja.

We will also use the link above for learning Stateful Widgets, but idk yet. 

We could make branches for every new tutorial we do, or maybe just add a message to the commit block. We will see. Good luck!!
